\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{H}{and} pose estimation plays an pivotal role in application of human-computer interface(HCI) and augmentation reality(AR).
So far, there are a plenty of researches on this topic\cite{guo2017region}, but it is still challenge to estimate hand pose in the actual scene
owing to the large view variance, high joint flexibility, poor depth quality, severe self-occlusion and similar part confusion.

We summary our contribution in the following two folds:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  We integrate features from depth map and 3D volumetric representation for hand pose estimation.
  The experiment reveals that 3D volumetric representation helps the hand structure.
  \item
  To our knowledge, it is the first time to consider temporal context in hand pose estimation.
  We model the coherence among frames by LSTM, and implement a hand pose estimation system with an eye to accuracy,
  efficiency, robustness and stability simultaneously.
  \item
  We evaluate our approach on two open datasets( e.g. NYU and ICVL), and get the comparable results.
\end{itemize}

\section{Our Method}\label{sec:our method}
% prepare the notation for problem
Our objective is to predict the 3D hand joint locations from a depth image, the locations are represented as a set of keypoints.
We give some notations about the problem. We denote a sequence of depth images as $\mathcal{I}=\{I_t\}_{t=1}^T$,
and the corresponding hand poses are $\mathcal{P}=\{P_t\}_{t=1}^T$. $P_t$ is the pose of hand in the form of $n$
hand joints of its joints $P_t=\{j_i\}_i^n$ with $j_i=(x_i,y_i,z_i)$ from the depth image $I_t$.

In the following, we describe our method for regressing the 3D hand pose. Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} shows the total
architecture for joints prediction. Aspired by Mixture of Experts~\cite{jacobs1991adaptive}, using a gated network to
control two expert networks. In general, network is composed of two parts: gated network and expert networks.
Each experts predicts the 3D pose given the input, gated network weights the prediction by each experts.
The experts concentrate on different information. LSTM-CNN takes temporal context into account between the consecutive frames.
Fusion-CNN, thinking over spatial information, fuses the features from depth map and 3D volumetric representation.
The LSTM-CNN and Fusion-CNN we employ are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:lstm netowork} and Section~\ref{sec:fusion network}.
And the mixture of experts are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:gated network}.

    Each experts predicts the 3D pose given the input, gated network weights the prediction by each experts.}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{LSTM Based Network}\label{sec:lstm netowork}
As we know, the hand poses between frames are correlated(e.g. when grabbing, the joints on fingers are most likely to be closer).
However, there are no approaches considering the coherence of successive frames in hand pose estimation.

Currently, an Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) units~\cite{zaremba2014learning} is widely used
because they are expressive and easy to train. The LSTM network is mostly used for modeling the long term temporal correspondence.
As the architecture in Fig~\ref{fig:lstm network}. The input is a successive sequence of frames.
Based on a simple baseline network shown in Fig~\ref{fig:baseline network}, we replace the last fully connected layer as an LSTM.
To reserve the features from previous layer, we concatenate features from first fully connected layer and LSTM, and regress hand joint locations.

        \end{minipage}
    }
\caption{Baseline and LSTM-CNN network. Regressing the hand joint location in 3D.}
\label{fig:baseline and lstm network}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Fusion Network}\label{sec:fusion network}
According to the discussion in \cite{supancic2015depth} and \cite{deng2017hand3d}, a 3D volumetric representation helps the hand pose estimation.
So we project the hand in 2D depth map into 3D space, a bit difference is we slice the space into 8 layers, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fusion network}.
The 3D volumetric representation keep the structure of hand, we can clearly find all finger tips in the first layer. However, the 3D convolution
is a high-cost manipulation for a real-time application, a straight-forward idea is simulation for 3D convolution. Hopf.etal\cite{hopf1999accelerating}
combines a 2D convolution and a 1D convolution kernel to emulate a 3D separable convolution. Follow the notation in \cite{ji20133d}, the value at position $(x,y,z)$
in the $j$th feature cube in the $i$th layer, which is denoted as $v_{ij}^{xyz}$, is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3D convolution}
v_{ij}^{xyz}=b_{ij} + \sum_{m}\sum_{p=0}^{P_i-1}\sum_{q=0}^{Q_i-1}\sum_{r=0}^{R_i-1} w_{ijm}^{pqr} v_{(i-1)m}^{(x+p)(y+q)(z+r)}
\end{equation}
where $b_{ij}$ is the bias for $j$th feature cube, $m$ is the index of the previous feature cube, $P_i, Q_i, R_i$ is the height and width yet depth of the kernel respectively,
$w_{ijm}^{pqr}$ represents the value at position $(p, q, r)$ of the kernel connected to the $m$th feature cube. To speedup the convolution,
with the assumption of separable kernel that $W^{pqr}_i = W^{pq}_{1i} W^{r}_{2i}$, where $W_i \in R^{P_i \times Q_i \times R_i}$, $W_{1i} \in R^{P_i \times Q_i}$
and $W_{2i} \in R^{R_i}$, Eq.~\ref{eq:3D convolution} is equivalent to 2D convolution and 1D convolution:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3D to 2D and 1D}
\begin{aligned}
v_{ij}^{xyz}
&=b_{ij} + \sum_{m}\sum_{p=0}^{P_i-1}\sum_{q=0}^{Q_i-1}\sum_{r=0}^{R_i-1} w_{ijm}^{pqr} v_{(i-1)m}^{(x+p)(y+q)(z+r)} \\
&=b_{ij} + \sum_{r}^{R_i-1}w_{2ij}^{r}(\sum_{m}\sum_{p=0}^{P_i-1}\sum_{q=0}^{Q_i-1} w_{1ijm}^{pq} v_{(i-1)m}^{(x+p)(y+q)(z+r)}) \\
&=b_{ij} + \sum_{r}^{R_i-1}w_{2ij}^{r} \hat{v}_{ij}^{xy(z+r)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{v}_{ij}^{xy(z+r)}$ is approximated by the grouped 2D convolution, and 1D convolution could be implemented by the 1x1 convolution.

In our opinion, 3D convolution could grab the structure of hand, but it lacks the ability to estimate depth of hand joints. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fusion network}, 
we use a Deep-Fusion framework~\cite{chen2016multi} to fuse the features. In the fusion network, the different features are fused together hierarchically. 
which could be expressed as: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:deep fusion}
\begin{aligned}
&f_0 = f_{depth} \oplus f_{3D} \\
&f_l = \textbf{H}_l^{depth}(f_{l-1}) \oplus \textbf{H}_l^{3D}(f_{l-1}) \\
&\forall l=1, \dots , L
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The $\oplus$ is element-wise mean, $\textbf{H}$ is the transformation for features, $l$ is the index for layer.

What's more, to have a robust feature, we use an auxiliary loss as the regularization. In Fig.~\ref{fig:fusion network}, 
the auxiliary path is useful only in training phase, and the layers connected by the blue dotted line share weights. 
When training, the total losses are composed by three losses, i.e. three regression loss in different branch. 
When testing, the auxiliary pathes are removed.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
